## Abstract
With the popularity and development of the wearable devices such as smartphones, human activity recognition (HAR) based on sensors has become as a key research area in human computer interaction and ubiquitous computing. The emergence of deep learning leads to a recent shift in the research of HAR, which requires massive strictly labeled data in supervised learning scenario. In comparison with video data, activity data recorded from accelerometer or gyroscope are often more difficult to interpret and segment. Recently, several attention mechanisms are proposed to handle the weakly labeled human activity data, which do not require accurate data annotation. However, these attention-based models can only handle the weakly labeled dataset whose sample includes one target activity, as a result it limits efficiency and practicality. In the article, we propose a recurrent attention networks (RAN) to handle sequential weakly labeled multiactivity recognition and location tasks. The model can repeatedly perform steps of attention on multiple activities of one sample and each step is corresponding to the current focused activity. The effectiveness of the RAN model is validated on a collected sequential weakly labeled multiactivity dataset and the other two public datasets. The experiment results show that our RAN model can simultaneously infer multiactivity types from the coarse-grained sequential weak labels and determine specific locations of every target activity with only knowledge of which types of activities contained in the long sequence. It will greatly reduce the burden of manual labeling.
